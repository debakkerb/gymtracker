# Gym Session Tracker

A new Flutter project.  Completely generated by Claude Code.

## Run Instructions

### Backend

To run the backend, point your terminal to `./backend` and run the following command: 

```shell
dart run bin/server.dart
```

### Frontend

To run the frontend, run the following command in `./mobile`:

```shell
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000
```

This will normally open the browser on the correct page.

## App Structure

The app offers the following functionalities:
- Ability to define exercises
- Ability to define a workout, consisting of a title and 1 or more exercises.  For each exercise, you can configure the number of repetitions and how many series.  For example, if you want to run 3 series of squats, with 15 repetitions each, you can add an exercise to the Workout, with 15 reps and 3 series.
- Ability to start a session.  Sessions loop over each exercise, and track how much time you are spending.  In between each series, a 2 min rest period is added

## Data

For now, all data is stored in SQLite.  The database is stored in ./backend/gymtracker.db.  Data is persisted across sessions, so you can shut down the server.  If you bring it up again, all data will still be there, so you don't have to redefine each exercise/workout.
